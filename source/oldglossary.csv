Term (s),Description,Notation
"Data object (point, observation, sample, example)","A unit of analysis. Typically, a data object is represented as a <b>vector</b> of <b>features</b>.","Typically denoted as lower case letter, often bold, e.g., \(\bf x\) or \({\bf x}_i\) or \({\bf x}^{(i)}\), where the subscript or superscript \(i\) denotes membership in a <b>data set</b>." 
"Data set","A collection of data objects.","Typically denoted as upper case letter, often bold, e.g., \(\bf X\). " 
"Vector","A list (or array) of real values (\(\in \{-\infty,\infty\}\)).","Typically denoted as bold lower case letter, e.g., \(\bf x\). <br/>\(\bf x \in \mathbb{R}^d\), means that the vector represents a point in a \(d\)-dimensional vector space.<br/>  An individual element of the vector is denoted as \(x_i\)." 
"Matrix","A 2-way array of real values (\(\in \{-\infty,\infty\}\)).","Typically denoted as bold upper case letter, e.g., \(\bf X\). <br/>\(\bf X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\), means that the matrix has \(m\) rows and \(n\) columns. A vector is represented as a \(m \times 1\) matrix.<br/> An individual element of the matrix is denoted as \(X_{ij}\)." 
"Transpose","\({\bf X}^\top\), \({\bf x}^\top\)","A transpose of a matrix is an operator which flips a matrix over its diagonal, i.e., \(X_{ij} = X^\top_{ji}\). Transpose of a vector is a \(1 \times d\) matrix. " 
"Matrix multiplication","\({\bf X} = {\bf YZ}\)","Only valid if the number of columns in \({\bf Y}\) is equal to the number of rows in \({\bf Z}\).<br/>The \(ij^{th}\) entry of the matrix \({\bf Z}\) is the dot product (see below) between the \(i^{th}\) row of \({\bf X}\) and \(j^{th}\) column of \({\bf Y}\), i.e., $$Z_{ij} = X_{i*}^\top Y_{*j}$$ Where \(X_{i*}\) denotes the \(i^{th}\) row of \({\bf X}\) and \(Y_{*j}\) is the \(j^{th}\) column of \({\bf Y}\)" 
"Vector dot (inner) product","\({\bf x}.{\bf x} = \sum_{i=1}^d x_i^2\)","In matrix notation, the dot product is expressed as \({\bf x}^\top{\bf x}\)" 
"Data Matrix","A \(n \times d\) matrix, \({\bf X}\)","If each data object in a data set can be represented as a vector in \(\mathbb{R}^d\), the data set of \(n\) such objects is typically arranged as a \(n \times d\) matrix, \({\bf X}\), where the transpose of each row of the matrix corresponds to a data object, i.e., \({\bf x}_i = X_{i*}^\top\)."

Here are some examples of how we, in the `University at Buffalo Data Science research group <https://www.cse.buffalo.edu/ubds>`, are using machine learning for many different types of applications

Unsupervised learning
---------------------

* Next generation manufacturing
* Next generation space crafts

Time series Predictive Models
-----------------------------

* Failures in big data centers and supercomputerssystems
* Risk of readmission in patients
* Risk of opioid induced disorders in patients admitted to PACUs
* Human mobility using GPS traces
* Next generation insulin pumps for diabetes patients
